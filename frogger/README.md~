Assignment 4: Frogger Part 2

All required aspects of assignment 4 have been implemented along with 2 additional requirements.  When frogger dies, it animates the death png, and there is a timer displayed on the bottom of the screen.  IF the timer runs out, frogger dies, and if there is extra time when frogger arrives home, then he/she recieves points for the remaining time.  

I spent approximately 20-25 hours working on this project.  I worked with Brett Cadigan on some portions of this project.
